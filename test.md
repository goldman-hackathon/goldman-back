  - New function 'void' added to check for any empty cells in the matrix.
  - 'Safe' function introduced to verify consistency in all rows, columns, and boxes.
  - 'Consistent' function implemented to prevent duplicates in a row.
  - 'Blocked' function added to check if the matrix is void or not safe.
  - New solving method 'solve4' introduced.
  - 'Search' function added to find solutions if the matrix is not blocked and not all cells are single.
  - 'Expand' function implemented to generate new matrices for non-single cells.

  - A new function `solve3` has been added. This function filters valid grids from the collapsed, pruned choices.
  - A new function `fix` has been introduced. This function takes a function and a variable as arguments and applies the function to the variable until the result is equal to the variable.

  - The import statement was updated to include the list difference operator (\\) from the Data.List module.
  - New functions were added: 'prune', 'reduce', 'minus', 'single', and 'solve2', all contributing to the process of solving a grid.
Report for Simple: - File: Sudoku.hs
  - A new type alias `Choices` has been added, representing a list of `Value`.
  - The `nodups` function has been expanded with additional functions.
  - Four new functions have been introduced:
    - `solve`: Filters valid grids from collapsed choices.
    - `choices`: Maps choices for each value in the grid.
    - `cp`: Generates combinations of elements from a list of lists.
    - `collapse`: Collapses a matrix of choices into a list of matrices.

## Summary

### Best Solution
In the `Sudoku.hs` file, several new functions were added to enhance the Sudoku solving process. These include `void` to check for empty cells, `safe` to verify row, column, and box consistency, and `consistent` to prevent row duplicates. The `blocked` function was introduced to check if the matrix is void or unsafe. A new solving method, `solve4`, and a `search` function were added to find solutions for non-blocked matrices with non-single cells. The `expand` function was implemented to generate new matrices for non-single cells.

### Even Better Solution
In the `Sudoku.hs` file, a new function `solve3` was added to filter valid grids from the collapsed, pruned choices. A new function `fix` was introduced, which applies a function to a variable until the result equals the variable.
