Report for best solution: Summary of changes in Sudoku.hs:
- Added functions `void`, `safe`, `consistent`, `blocked`, `solve4`, `search`, and `expand`
- These functions are related to solving the Sudoku puzzle
- They are used to check if a matrix of choices is valid, prune the choices, and search for a solution
- The `expand` function is used to generate possible choices for the next step in the search process
Report for even better solution: Changes in Sudoku.hs:
- Added a new function `solve3` which filters valid grids by collapsing and fixing the choices using the `prune` function.
- Added a new function `fix` which takes a function and applies it repeatedly until the result doesn't change.
- Removed the newline at the end of the file.
Report for Better solution: Changes in Sudoku.hs:
- Modified import statement to include the (\\) function from Data.List.
- Added functions: prune, reduce, minus, and single.
- Added solve2 function, which filters valid grids after collapsing and pruning choices.
- Added solve3, void, safe, blocked, and solve4 functions.
- Added search and expand functions.
- File ends with a missing newline character.
Report for Simple: Changes in Sudoku.hs:
- Added a new type `Choices` which is a list of `Value`
- Added a `choices` function that converts a `Grid` into a `Matrix Choices`
- Added a `solve` function that filters valid grids from the result of collapsing the choices
- Added a `cp` function that generates all possible combinations of a list of lists
- Added a `collapse` function that generates all possible combinations of a matrix of lists

## Summary

- The "best solution" pull request adds several functions related to solving the Sudoku puzzle, such as `void`, `safe`, `consistent`, `blocked`, `solve4`, `search`, and `expand`.
- The "even better solution" pull request introduces a new function `solve3` that filters valid grids by collapsing and fixing the choices using the `prune` function. It also adds a `fix` function that applies a given function repeatedly until the result doesn't change.
- The "better solution" pull request modifies the import statement, adds several functions (`prune`, `reduce`, `minus`, `single`), and introduces the `solve2` function that filters valid grids after collapsing and pruning choices.
- The "simple" pull request adds a new type `Choices`, along with functions like `choices`, `solve`, `cp`, and `collapse` that are used for solving the Sudoku puzzle.

Overall, these pull requests introduce various improvements and additions to the Sudoku solving functionality, including new functions, type definitions, and modifications to existing code.
Based on the file diffs, it appears that the idea of the search function in the best solution is to recursively search for a valid solution to the Sudoku puzzle by trying different combinations of possible choices for each empty cell in the grid. 

In the "Sudoku.hs" file, the "search" function is defined as follows:
```
search :: Matrix Choices -> [Grid]
search m | blocked m = []
         | all (all single) m = collapse m
         | otherwise = 
            [g | m' <- expand m, g <- search (prune m')]
```

The function takes a matrix of choices as input and returns a list of valid solutions. 

The "blocked" function is used to check if the matrix is blocked, which means that there are empty cells with no possible choices or the matrix is not safe (i.e., there are duplicate choices in any of the rows, columns, or boxes).

If the matrix is blocked, an empty list is returned.

If all the cells in the matrix have only one choice (i.e., they are single), the matrix is collapsed and returned as a valid solution.

Otherwise, the matrix is expanded by selecting one of the cells with multiple choices and creating different matrix variations by choosing each possible value for that cell. The "prune" function is applied to each variation to eliminate choices that conflict with already filled cells or violate the Sudoku rules. The "search" function is then recursively called on each pruned matrix variation, and the resulting valid solutions are concatenated and returned.

In the provided file diffs, the "search" function is added to the "Sudoku.hs" file in the "even better solution" and "best solution" pull requests. It is not present in the "Better solution" pull request.
