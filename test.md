## Summary

### Multifunctional reverse: - reverse.pl
- Additional arguments are added to the `rev` predicate definition
- Comments are added to explain the purpose and usage of the accumulator and reversed accumulator arguments
- The `rev` predicate is modified to include the additional arguments in recursive calls
- The last line of the file is modified to include a newline

### Solution with accumulator: Changes in the file reverse.pl
- The second argument in the `rev` predicate is renamed to "Accumulator"
- The `rev` predicate now takes three arguments instead of four, with the third argument being the accumulator
- The implementation of the `rev` predicate is modified to achieve O(N) complexity using the accumulator
- A new base case is added for an empty list, where the accumulator is the same as the reversed list
- Pattern matching is used to construct the reversed list with the accumulator
