Report for best solution: Summary of changes in Sudoku.hs:
- Added functions `void`, `safe`, `consistent`, `blocked`, `solve4`, `search`, and `expand`
- These functions are related to solving the Sudoku puzzle
- They are used to check if a matrix of choices is valid, prune the choices, and search for a solution
- The `expand` function is used to generate possible next steps in the search process
Report for even better solution: Changes in Sudoku.hs:
- Added a new function `solve3` which filters valid grids by collapsing and fixing the choices using the `prune` function.
- Added a new function `fix` which takes a function and applies it repeatedly until the result doesn't change.
- Removed the newline at the end of the file.
Report for Better solution: Changes in Sudoku.hs:
- Modified import statement to include the (\\) function from Data.List.
- Added functions: prune, reduce, minus, and single.
- Added solve2 function, which filters valid grids after collapsing and pruning choices.
- Added solve3, void, safe, blocked, and solve4 functions.
- Added search and expand functions.
- File ends with a missing newline character.
Report for Simple: Changes in Sudoku.hs:
- Added a new type `Choices` which is a list of `Value`
- Added a `choices` function that converts a `Grid` into a `Matrix Choices`
- Added a `solve` function that filters valid grids from the result of collapsing the choices
- Added a `cp` function that generates all possible combinations of a list of lists
- Added a `collapse` function that generates all possible combinations of a matrix of lists

## Summary

The best solution for the Sudoku puzzle involves adding several functions to the `Sudoku.hs` file. These functions are used to solve the puzzle by checking the validity of the choices, pruning the choices, and searching for a solution. The even better solution builds upon the best solution by adding a new function to filter valid grids by collapsing and fixing the choices. The better solution modifies the import statement, adds more functions, and ends with a missing newline character. The simple solution adds a new type, functions to convert and solve the puzzle, and functions to generate combinations.
